        <h2>Life Experience</h2>
       <p>Working for so many years in customer service, I have developed skills in working with people from all different backgrounds and walks of life. In restaraunts, bars, and, coffee shops I built rep ore with regular clientele and learned how to work with people to create satisfying experiences for all parties involved. During my years working in research I had to hone my organizational skills using xcell to manage and store large amounts of data, as well as build time management and project design skills. I feel that Nursing encompassed all of the previously mentioned skills and added working with interdisciplinary teams that do not always see eye to eye. Working with patients also requires a large amount of empathy and patience that only came with time and experience.
