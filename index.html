        <h2 class="card-title">Background</h2>
        <p>My educational background consists of Bachelor degrees in Biology and Nursing. I have been working as a registered nurse for over 8 years, and currently work on an orthopedic and neurology based floor. Prior to working as an RN, I spent 3 years in genetic research working with select agent bacteria, and about 10 years working in many aspects of customer service.</p>
        <p>I have decided that it is time for me to step away from nursing and start a new educational and professional path with a focus on web development.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 class="card-title">Goals</h2>
        <p>In the short term, my goals are to learn and become proficient at:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML 5</li>
          <li>CSS 3</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>VSC</li>
          <li>GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My long term goal is to gain the knowledge and means for producing web sites that create an intuitive and enjoyable experience for all users.
        </p>
        <p>I am open to any position in web development, from working for a large firm to freelance, until I find the area that fits me best.
